## Why is it here?

This prototype serves as a **reference for developers** interested in:
- How to structure a Kivy project
- Setting up Buildozer for Android builds
- Understanding early development iterations

## What's NOT in this prototype?

- ❌ Display of a meaningful sun position
- ❌ Single-hand clock design
- ❌ The real Sun Clock concept
