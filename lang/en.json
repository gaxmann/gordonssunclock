    "txmanual": "[DF]Dial",
    "txanleitung2": "[DF]{txgordonssunclock-} is essentially a single-hand clock with a dial that changes daily, based on the rhythms of nature and the stars. It shows the position of the sun and the starry sky. It is a new way of displaying time that is not artificial like our conventional clocks (with railway time and daylight saving time), but moves in harmony with the seasons.[~LF][~LF][i]NOTE: You can swipe back and forth between these instructions and the dial.[/i][~LF][~LF][~LF][b]–– Your view:[/b][~LF][~LF]In the centre of the screen, you will see a horizontal line. This is the horizon (the Earth's surface). The pointed triangle in the middle is a spruce tree that you see in the distance (or a church). You are not looking down on it from above, but standing in front of it.[~LF][~LF]If you have not changed the settings (‘Viewing direction: automatic’), you are usually looking south in the northern hemisphere (north in the southern hemisphere). Objects on the left of the screen are in the east, those on the right are in the west (reversed in the southern hemisphere). The cardinal points are shown at the edge of the horizon.[~LF][~LF]The lighter strip below the horizon indicates civil twilight. The large, dark grey area symbolises night (including nautical twilight). Objects located in this area are not visible.[~LF][~LF]At the bottom left, you can see the local time, at the top right the height of the sun in degrees in the sky (e.g. 27.6°) and your position as a numerical code (e.g. ‘cri-hs’) or a place name (if you have entered one). Below that, the unequal temporal hour display.",
    "txanleitung2b": "[DF][DF][b]–– Sun:[/b][~LF][~LF]The sun (at the end of the clock’s single hand) moves during the day from left to right (reversed in the Southern Hemisphere). The farther left the sun is on the screen, the more it is in the east; the farther right, the more it is in the west (reversed in the Southern Hemisphere). The higher the sun appears on the screen, the higher it is in the sky.[~LF][~LF]The sun follows the drawn circular path on which it moves within a day. At the edge of the circular path, hours are shown (e.g. „12“ o’clock), so the circular path also functions as a dial.[~LF][~LF]On the dial, for example, you can see how the numbers shift during daylight saving time, while the circular path remains the same. Or: how legal time in most places deviates from local solar time, because 12 o’clock is not exactly at the top of the dial. Temporal hours do it differently: at the 12th hour (12ἡ) it is always sunset.[~LF][~LF][~LF][b]–– Moon:[/b][~LF][~LF]The moon also has a circular path, drawn in light grey. Since the moon needs more than 24 hours for one revolution, 1.5 hours from the previous day are appended in extra light grey. If you „live with the clock“, you can clearly see how the moon winds higher and lower over 27 days. You can also observe how, at full moon, it stands opposite the sun in the circular position (far away); at new moon, however, it is at the same circular position (close to the sun). It is usually not exactly the same position because the view is from the side (not from above). It is exactly the same position only during a solar eclipse.[~LF][~LF]Full moon and new moon are marked by shadows. New moon is shown for 35 hours (because that is the time during which you cannot see the moon at all). Full moon is shown for 24 hours. The recalculation of the sun and moon paths takes place each day at UTC 00:00.",
    "txanleitung2c": "[DF][DF][b]–– Planets:[/b][~LF][~LF]The five planets visible to the naked eye are shown, with photos as you would see them through binoculars, or (depending on the design) represented by their astronomical symbols (see previous page). If you look at the real night sky, you can distinguish planets from stars by knowing that planets do not twinkle but shine steadily. They appear noticeably larger in the sky than the far-away stars and are therefore not influenced as strongly by fluctuations in atmospheric density.[~LF][~LF][~LF][b]–– Stars:[/b][~LF][~LF]In addition, the ten brightest stars are shown, symbolized by a letter in a square (legend see previous page). While the planets stay relatively orderly, mostly more or less near the sun’s path, the path of the stars is independent of the sun – after all, they are their own sun. In the star symbols, two sides of the square are always drawn more strongly than the other two. This indicates the corner or quadrant of their path in which they are currently located. If the highlighted corner is at the bottom right, the star is (more or less) at the „end“ of its path downwards and to the right. In its further movements it will mainly move upwards and to the left (often also outside the screen). If the top side is stronger, the star is in front of you; if the bottom side is stronger, behind you (if you have not changed the rotation direction).",
    "txanleitung2d": "[DF][DF][b]–– History:[/b][~LF][~LF]{txgordonssunclock-} was developed in 2019 for a Raspberry Pi with a 10-inch ePaper display because I wanted a wall clock that was pleasant to look at and connected the time with the sun's path. My goal was to build a clock that shows natural time – not man-made time, as represented by the 12-hour analogue clock. Where we live, there are significant differences in the length of the day throughout the year, as well as the recurring, unpopular time change. Sun Clock was designed to put all of this into perspective: it displays an organic dial that is oriented towards the seasons, the rhythm of nature, and changes with it. Since almost everyone has a small computer in their pocket these days, I developed Sun Clock 2025 as an Android app. I hope you enjoy it and find it insightful![DF][DF][DF]",
