    "txmanual": "[DF]Dial",
    "txanleitung2": "[DF]{txgordonssunclock-} is essentially a single-hand clock with a dial that changes daily, based on the rhythms of nature and the stars. It shows the position of the sun and the starry sky. It is a new way of displaying time that is not artificial like our conventional clocks (with railway time and daylight saving time), but moves in harmony with the seasons.[~LF][~LF][i]NOTE: You can swipe back and forth between these instructions and the dial.[/i][~LF][~LF][~LF][b]–– Your view:[/b][~LF][~LF]In the centre of the screen, you will see a horizontal line. This is the horizon (the Earth's surface). The pointed triangle in the middle is a spruce tree that you see in the distance (or a church). You are not looking down on it from above, but standing in front of it.[~LF][~LF]If you have not changed the settings (‘Viewing direction: automatic’), you are usually looking south in the northern hemisphere (north in the southern hemisphere). Objects on the left of the screen are in the east, those on the right are in the west (reversed in the southern hemisphere). The cardinal points are shown at the edge of the horizon.[~LF][~LF]The lighter strip below the horizon indicates civil twilight. The large, dark grey area symbolises night (including nautical twilight). Objects located in this area are not visible.[~LF][~LF]At the bottom left, you can see the local time, at the top right the height of the sun in degrees in the sky (e.g. 27.6°) and your position as a numerical code (e.g. ‘cri-hs’) or a place name (if you have entered one). Below that, the unequal temporal hour display.",
    "txanleitung2b": "[DF][DF][b]–– Sun:[/b][~LF][~LF]The sun (at the end of the clock's single hand) moves from left to right throughout the day (reversed in the southern hemisphere). The further to the left the sun is on the screen, the further east it is; the further to the right, the further west (reversed in the southern hemisphere). The higher the sun is on the screen, the higher it is in the sky.[~LF][~LF]The sun follows the marked circular path on which it moves within a day. Hours are indicated at the edge of the circular path (e.g. ‘12’ o'clock), so that the circular path also functions as a clock face.[~LF][~LF]On the clock face, for example, you can see how the numbers shift during the time change, but the circular path remains the same. Or: how the legal time in most places differs from the local time, as 12 o'clock is not exactly at the top of the clock face. The temporal hours are different: The 12th hour (12ἡ) is always sunset.[~LF][~LF][~LF][b]–– Moon:[/b][~LF][~LF]The moon also has an orbit. It is drawn as a light grey circle (without hands). Since the moon takes more than 24 hours to complete one orbit, two additional hours (from yesterday) are added in extra light grey. If you ‘live by the clock’, you can clearly see how the moon periodically rises and falls over weeks. You can also observe how it opposes the Sun in the circle position (far away) at full moon, but is in the same circle position (close to the Sun) at new moon. It is usually not exactly the same position because the view is from the side (not from above). It is only exactly the same position during a solar eclipse.[~LF][~LF]Full moon and new moon are marked by shadows. New moon is displayed for 35 hours (because that is the time when the moon cannot be seen at all). Full moon is displayed for 24 hours. The recalculation of the sun and moon's orbits takes place at UTC 00:00.",
    "txanleitung2c": "[DF][DF][b]–– Planets:[/b][~LF][~LF]The five planets visible to the naked eye are shown, with photos of how they would appear through binoculars or (depending on the design) represented by their astronomical symbols (see page 2). When you look at the real starry sky, you can distinguish planets from stars by knowing that planets do not twinkle but shine steadily. They appear much larger in the sky than distant stars and are therefore not as strongly affected by density fluctuations in the atmosphere.[~LF][~LF][~LF][b]–– Stars:[/b][~LF][~LF]Next, the ten brightest stars are shown, symbolised by a letter in a square (see page 2 for legend). While the planets are relatively orderly, mostly more or less close to the sun's orbit, the stars' orbits are independent of the sun – they are their own sun. In the star symbols, two sides of the square are always drawn more strongly than the other two. This indicates the corner or quadrant of their orbit in which they are currently located. If the highlighted corner is at the bottom right, the star is (more or less) at the ‘end’ of its trajectory downwards and to the right. It will mainly move upwards and to the left (often outside the screen) as it continues its journey. If the upper side is stronger, the star is in front of you; if the lower side is stronger, it is behind you (unless you have changed the direction of rotation).",
    "txanleitung2d": "[DF][DF][b]–– History:[/b][~LF][~LF]{txgordonssunclock-} was developed in 2019 for a Raspberry Pi with a 10-inch ePaper display because I wanted a wall clock that was pleasant to look at and connected the time with the sun's path. My goal was to build a clock that shows natural time – not man-made time, as represented by the 12-hour analogue clock. Where we live, there are significant differences in the length of the day throughout the year, as well as the recurring, unpopular time change. Sun Clock was designed to put all of this into perspective: it displays an organic dial that is oriented towards the seasons, the rhythm of nature, and changes with it. Since almost everyone has a small computer in their pocket these days, I developed Sun Clock 2025 as an Android app. I hope you enjoy it and find it insightful![DF][DF][DF]",
