The German language file ("de.json") IS THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE. It is best to start a translation from German (if possible). The English language is the fallback language, that will be chosen if your local translation does not exist. 

If you translate languages, please leave all control codes unchanged: 

- [XXXXXX] and {xxxxxx} are variables that will be replaced during run time
- [-LF-] are linefeeds (as in "\n"). You can replace them with real linefeeds
- [DF] and [SP] are control codes for distances in the design


About the entries in the local language dictionary:

- "quotes" are the local quotes, as in: „Hello“ or «Hello»


In the local language dictionary, you will find entries that will help to correctly separate words in the local language. These are listed below. If you don't know what to enter, just leave them empty as in: "" or []
