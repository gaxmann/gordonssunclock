# Gordon's Sun Clock

Here are some files of the Sun Clock app. 

You are most welcome to... 

- create new images of celestial bodies (if the license allows its use)
- create translations for new languages or correct existing ones  
- maybe submit new designs (I do not accept all design suggestions): Designs consist either of
(a) 3-5 colours (for: day >6° | sunset -0.8333...6° | civil twilight -6...-0.8333° | nautical twilight -12...-6° | night <-12°) or
(b) 3-5 images (day >-0.8333° | twilight -6...-0.8333° | night <-6°, best if the size is around 1000 x 1000 px for the two large images)
