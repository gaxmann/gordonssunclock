# Gordon's Sun Clock

Here are a few of the files of the Sun Clock app. 

You are most welcome to... 

1. create new images of celestial bodies (if they are your own or the licence allows its use)
2. contribute translations into new languages or improve existing ones (German is the original language)  
3. submit new design proposals (please note that I may not accept all suggestions – sending an email in advance is a good idea): a design consist either of (a) three to five hex RGB colour codes or (b) three to five stacked images (ideally, the two larger images should be about 1000 × 1000 px in size). - I love art that preserves values and uplifts the spirit (e.g. Claude Monet, William Turner, Paul Klee, Vincent van Gogh, Pieter Brueghel, August Macke, Max Liebermann, Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne, Henri Rousseau, Gustave Courbet), but I don't dare to use other people's photos of it. 
- 3.1. five zones: (i) day (>6°) | (ii) sunset (6...-0.8333°) | (iii) civil twilight (-0.8333...-6°) | (iv) nautical twilight (-6...-12°) | (v) night (<-12°)
