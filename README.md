# Gordon's Sun Clock – The Natural Time

<img src="res/icon.png" width="48" height="48" align="left">**A single-hand clock with a dial that changes daily, based on the rhythms of nature and the stars. It shows the position of the sun and the starry sky – a new way of displaying time that moves in harmony with the seasons.**

## Why?

I was dissatisfied with standard time, the recurring time changes and the fact that 12 o'clock is usually not noon. My solution: an organic dial that shows the sun's actual position and path, when it's truly noon, and when the sun disappears below the horizon – all calculated for your individual location.

**Reconnect to your local, natural time.**

The app is free, shows no ads, and collects no data. It's simply a gift from me to the world.

## About

I've been living with this clock for seven years, and it has taught me a lot. It helps reconnect with natural rhythms – not just daily, but seasonally. It's also fascinating for children to understand the movements of the stars intuitively.

Since June 2025 Sun Clock is available as an Android app. The app is also known as: astronomical clock, astronomy app, horologium, horologion, orloj, astrolabe, star clock, sky clock, single-hand clock, solar clock, temporal hour clock.

## What are Temporal Hours?

Temporal hours (also called unequal hours) divide the day and night into 12 hours each (or 4 night watches) – but unlike modern equal hours, these hours change length with the seasons: This ancient time system was used throughout history until mechanical clocks standardized hours. Sun Clock offers a window into how our ancestors experienced time.

## Contributing

This repository is used as a content hub for design proposals, asset exchange and apk distribution. The apk files are available under Releases. The main app source is not publicly available at this time, but you're welcome to contribute in the following areas:

### 1. Design Proposals
Submit new visual designs for the dial. A design consists of either:
- **(a)** Three to five hex RGB colour codes, or
- **(b)** Three to five stacked images (ideally, the two large images "day & night" are min. 1080×1080 px if possible)

I love art that preserves values and uplifts the spirit (e.g., Claude Monet, J. M. William Turner, Paul Klee, Vincent van Gogh, Pieter Brueghel, August Macke, Max Liebermann, Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne, Henri Rousseau, Gustave Courbet), but I don't dare to use other people's photos of it.

**Design zones guide:**
The differences between nautical twilight and night should be almost imperceptible.
- **5 zones**: day (>6°) | sunset (6...−0.8333°) | civil twilight (–0.8333...–6°) | nautical twilight (–6...–12°) | night (<–12°)
- **4 zones**: day (>–0.8333°) | civil twilight (–0.8333...–6°) | nautical twilight (–6...–12°) | night (<–12°)
- **3 zones**: day (>–0.8333°) | twilight (–0.8333...–6°) | night (<–6°)

*Note: Send an email (see last page of the app) before submitting – I may not accept all suggestions.*

### 2. Translations
Contribute translations into new languages or improve existing ones (German is the original).

### 3. Resources
Create new images of celestial bodies or assets (if original or properly licensed).
