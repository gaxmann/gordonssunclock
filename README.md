# Gordon's Sun Clock

Here are a few of the files of the Sun Clock app. 

You are most welcome to... 

- create new images of celestial bodies (if their yours or the license allows its use)
- gladly create translations for new languages or correct existing ones (German is the original language)  
- maybe submit new designs (I do not accept all design suggestions): a design consist either of
(a) 3 to 5 hex rgb colour codes (e.g. for: day (>6°) | sunset (-0.8333...6°) | civil twilight (-6...-0.8333°) | nautical twilight (-12...-6°) | night (<-12°)), or...  
(b) 3 to 5 images (e.g. for: day (>-0.8333°) | twilight (-6...-0.8333°) | night (<-6°)). Best if the size of the two large images is around 1000 x 1000 px.
