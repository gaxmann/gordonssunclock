# Gordon's Sun Clock – The Natural Time

<img src="res/icon.png" width="48" height="48" align="left">**A single-hand clock with a dial that changes daily, based on the rhythms of nature and the stars. It shows the position of the sun and the starry sky – a new way of displaying time that moves in harmony with the seasons.**

## Why?

I was dissatisfied with standard time, the recurring time changes and the fact that 12 o'clock is usually not noon. My solution: an organic dial that shows the sun's actual position and path, when it's truly noon, and when the sun disappears below the horizon – all calculated for your individual location.

**Reconnect to your local, natural time.**

The app is free, shows no ads, and collects no data. It's simply a gift from me to the world.

## About

I've been living with this clock for seven years, and it has taught me a lot. It helps reconnect with natural rhythms – not just daily, but seasonally. It's also fascinating for children to understand the movements of the stars intuitively.

The app is also known as: astronomical clock, astronomy app, horologium, horologion, orloj, astrolabe, star clock, sky clock, single-hand clock, solar clock.

## Contributing

The source code is not yet public, but you're welcome to contribute in these areas:

### 1. Design Proposals
Submit new visual designs for the dial. A design consists of either:
- **(a)** Three to five hex RGB color codes, or
- **(b)** Three to five stacked images (ideally, the two large images "day  & night" are min. ~1000 × 1000 px if possible)

I love art that preserves values and uplifts the spirit (e.g., Monet, Turner, Klee, van Gogh, Brueghel, Macke, Liebermann, Gauguin, Cézanne, Rousseau, Courbet), but I don't dare to use other people's photos of it.

**Design zones guide:**
The differences between nautical twilight and night should be almost imperceptible.
- **5 zones**: day (>6°) | sunset (6...−0.8333°) | civil twilight (–0.8333...–6°) | nautical twilight (–6...–12°) | night (<–12°)
- **4 zones**: day (>–0.8333°) | civil twilight (–0.8333...–6°) | nautical twilight (–6...–12°) | night (<–12°)
- **3 zones**: day (>–0.8333°) | twilight (–0.8333...–6°) | night (<–6°)

*Note: Send an email before submitting – I may not accept all suggestions.*

### 2. Translations
Contribute translations into new languages or improve existing ones (German is the original).

### 3. Resources
Create new images of celestial bodies or assets (if original or properly licensed).
